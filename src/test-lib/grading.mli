val clamp_opt : 'a clamp option -> 'a -> 'a
(** [clamp None x] is [x], otherwise as {!val-clamp}. *)

type grading_result = { text : string; points : int; max_points : int }
(** The result of grading a list of tests. *)

type tests = (string * bool) list
(** Pairs of [test_name, passed]. *)

type testsuites = tests list
(** A group of testsuites (e.g. as extracted from a single JUnit XML file) *)

(** Logical formulas over test results. *)
type grading_criterion =
  | Passed of string  (** Did the given test pass? *)
  | Failed of string  (** Did the given test fail? *)
  | Not of grading_criterion  (** Negation (logical not). *)
  | OneOf of grading_criterion list  (** Disjunction (logical or). *)
  | AllOf of grading_criterion list  (** Conjunction (logical and). *)
  | Constant of bool  (** Logical constant. *)
(** [Passed] and [Failed] values may use wildcards:

  - Trailing colon, e.g. [a:b:c:]: matches anything of which it is a prefix,
      e.g. [a:b:c:d:e] and [a:b:c].
  - Star as name, e.g. [a:*:c]: matches any name in place of [*],
      e.g. [a:mmm:c].

  Both may be combined, e.g. [a:*:c:] matches [a:mm:c] and [a:nn:c:d]. A name
  is considered to be any string that does not contain a [:]. You are
  responsible for enforcing this convention yourself, it is not enforced
  by OUnit, for example.

  For a [Passed] value to evaluate to true, {i all} tests matched by the
  wildcard need to pass, and for [Failed] all need to fail. If you want the
  inverse behavior ({i at least} one matched test needs to pass/fail),
  use [Not]: [Not (Failed "a:*:")] means "not all matched tests failed",
  which is logically equivalent to "at least one matched test passed".
  For this, you can use {!any_passed} and {!any_failed}.

  It is an error to reference a test that does not exist.
  In the presence of wildcards, at least one test must match.

(** Logical implication: [implies a c = OneOf [Not a; c]]. *)

val any_passed : string -> grading_criterion
(** If a test case contains a wildcard, the behavior is to require that all
    tests that match pass (or that all tests fail). Use [any_passed]

    passed (or at least one test that matches failed). *)

      evaluate to [true] and the reason is ["PENALTY"], otherwise {!No_reason} is raised
